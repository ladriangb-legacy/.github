# 🧩 ladriangb-legacy — .github Repository

This repository exists only to host shared files used by GitHub itself,  
such as the **organization profile README**, issue templates, and general documentation.

## 🧠 Purpose

The `.github` repository acts as the “meta” area for this organization.  
It contains configuration and documentation that apply to all other repositories here —  
mainly to show the organization profile through:

## 📂 Structure

```

.github/

├── profile/
│   └── README.md       ← Public organization profile (displayed on org homepage)
│
└── README.md

```

## 🧩 Context

The `ladriangb-legacy` organization keeps:
- **Old labs** and **forked code** I once modified or used for client work  
- Early experiments that later evolved into private or production projects  
- Archived technical references and test environments  

This `.github` repository only provides context and documentation for those archived projects.
